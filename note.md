# 📝 Project Notes - CS50 Week 0

## ✅ What I Did Today
- Completed CS50 Week 0 lectures and exercises
- Built a number guessing game using Scratch
- Re-implemented the game using Python

## 💡 What I Learned
- How to use variables, loops, and conditionals in Scratch
- How to use `input()`, `while`, and `if-elif-else` statements in Python
- How to generate random numbers using `random.randint()`

## 🤯 Challenges I Faced
- Scratch's `answer` variable is a string by default, which caused comparison issues
- I mistakenly wrote `else num==rand:` in Python, which I later corrected

## 🎯 My Goal for Tomorrow
- Start CS50 Week 2
- Learn how to write professional README files
- Keep building the habit of writing daily project notes

# 📘 CS50 Week 0 Summary

Today, I started Harvard’s CS50 course, and it completely changed the way I see computer science.

In Week 0, I learned the foundational concepts of how computers work. One of the key ideas was the **binary system**, which uses only `0` and `1`. From there, I discovered what **binary digits** are and how they relate to systems like **ASCII**, which maps characters to binary numbers.

However, the world doesn't use just English. We also have Chinese, Japanese, French, and many other languages. So I learned about **Unicode**, which allows computers to represent any character—including emojis, Chinese characters, and more—using binary digits.

Then I explored how **colors** are represented on screens using the **RGB system** (Red, Green, Blue). RGB works by adjusting the intensity of each of the three primary colors to produce millions of different colors.

The most important idea I learned was the core logic of how a computer works:
> **Input → Algorithm → Output**

Professor David Malan used **Scratch** to visually demonstrate how this logic flows in a program. Concepts like **loops**, **conditions**, and **variables** were not new to me, but using them in **English** and understanding them in a deeper way was a new challenge.

## 💻 Beyond the Course

Outside the lecture, I also completed my first programming project. I:
- Created a **number guessing game** in Python
- Built my **first GitHub repository**
- Uploaded the code, screenshots, and project files

Although I didn’t write the README and project notes entirely by myself today, I promise to write them on my own tomorrow. This entire process—from building the game to publishing it on GitHub—is completely new to me, but I feel proud of taking the first step.

This is just the beginning.
