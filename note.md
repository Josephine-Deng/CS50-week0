# 📝 Project Notes - CS50 Week 0

## ✅ What I Did Today
- Completed CS50 Week 0 lectures and exercises
- Built a number guessing game using Scratch
- Re-implemented the game using Python

## 💡 What I Learned
- How to use variables, loops, and conditionals in Scratch
- How to use `input()`, `while`, and `if-elif-else` statements in Python
- How to generate random numbers using `random.randint()`

## 🤯 Challenges I Faced
- Scratch's `answer` variable is a string by default, which caused comparison issues
- I mistakenly wrote `else num==rand:` in Python, which I later corrected

## 🎯 My Goal for Tomorrow
- Start CS50 Week 1 (C programming basics)
- Learn how to write professional README files
- Keep building the habit of writing daily project notes
