# CS50-week0
My first CS50 project using Scratch and Python
# what do I do
This project is a part of the CS50x coursework,I built a guess game by both Scratch and python
# project description
The game randomly gives a number between 1-10.
The player tries to guess the number,and the program will give some hints
- 'too small' if the guess is lower
- 'too big' if the guess is higher
- 'right' if the number is correct
# technologies used
- Scratch (visual programming)
- Python 3.x
- Git & GitHub for version control
# what I learned
- Using variables, conditionals, and loops in both Scratch and Python
- Converting logic from visual blocks to real code
- Handling data types and user input in Python
- Debugging logic errors (e.g., string vs. number comparison in Scratch)
# project files

- `number_guessing_game.py`: My Python implementation
- `notes.md`: My personal learning notes
# next steps
- Start CS50 Week 1 (C Language basics)
- Practice writing more detailed README files for future projects
